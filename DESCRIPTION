Title: Split Chromosome 'Fasta' File
Description: Chromosome files in the 'Fasta' format usually contain large sequences like human genome.
  Sometimes users have to split these chromosomes into different files according to their 
  chromosome number. The 'chromseq' can help to handle this. So the selected chromosome sequence can be
  used for downstream analysis like motif finding. Howard Y. Chang(2019)
